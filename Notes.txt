# We can reconfigure vite server i.e we can change port number
-Default port number- 5173
in vite.config.js file:
- server:
{
    port:3000
}

# LifeCycle of Components:
==========================
Every component have life cycle events:
1) Mounting  (born-appears on screen)
2) Updating    (made changes)
3) Unmounting  (out of screen)

# useEffect: (side effect function)
===================================
- Whenever we want to perform some oprations based on LifeCycle of the Components.
- useEffect hook connected to lifecycle of Components

- when change state component rerender that triggers TO  update lifecycle and due to this useEffect called.
-useState and useEffect are not connected 

-USEeffect CALLED BY Default
-we can use dependency array 

useEffect(()=>
{
    // do something
},[dependency array])

//To call api when component loaded
for ex.. loading all chats when chat component loaded not all things that will create mess.

to remove component: conditional rendering

useEffect(() => {
    console.log("component mounted");

// This is called when component unmounted
 return () => {
      console.log("component mounted unmounted");
    };

  }, [third]);
